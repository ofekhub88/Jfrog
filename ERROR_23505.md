 In this case, it could a permission issue or a known issue which we have fixed in 7.10.2 regarding join.key.

  First, please check the permissions under $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/ and make sure they are all owned by user same user ( default is artifactory )

  Next, check the join key value under $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/security/ and see if it's encrypted like:

6c3480ac09beeb9dccbf36f5cce14bca

  If that's the case, try delete the join key from db:

  DELETE FROM access_configs where config_name='shared.security.joinKey';
  
  Restart the instance and see if join.key value is resoted to like:

018cfad8e3fb2f335626169c8d7baa3a

  If so, copy the value and add place it in the system.yaml as follows:
shared:
    security:
        joinKey: 267c92e1fb3c0ad15cc1895b83af9a95
